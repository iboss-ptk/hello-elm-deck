# Hello, Elm!

---

## What is Elm?

---

_Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript,_

_focusing on building frontend application._

---

## Why should I care?

---

```
❌ TypeError: undefined is not a function
```

---

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
```

---

```elm
add a b = a + b
```

---

```elm
add : Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b
```

---
```elm
add 1 2 -- 3 : Int
```
---

```elm
add 1 -- <function> : Int -> Int
```
---

```elm
-- add : Int -> Int -> Int
-- add : Int -> (Int -> Int)
-- add 1 : Int -> Int
```
---
```js
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b

add(1)(2)

add(1)
```
---

```elm
inc : Int -> Int
inc = add 1
```
---

```elm
inc 5 -- 6 : Int
```

---

## Modeling Application State

---

```elm
type Switch
    = On
    | Off
```
